# Fermion-MIPT
Monitoring-induced phase transition for entanglement generated by emitting fermion modes through a linear optical network. Run_fermion_trajectories.py takes command-line input arguments to generate a number of trajectories and store them in a .npy file. submit_job and submit_trajectories are used to facilitate submission of series of independent jobs on cluster.

The Jupyter notebook loads in the generated data and is used for the data analysis.
